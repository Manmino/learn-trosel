      <h1>Learn Manmino</h1>
    </header>
    <p>This learning course is inspired by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margarita_Madrigal">Margarita Madrigal</a> and <a href="https://www.languagetransfer.org/">Language Transfer</a>.</p>
    <p>With very little grammatical explanation, you will begin to internalize the language. Don't try to memorize anything! Just take your time and really think through how to translate the phrases. And mistakes are ok! Each lesson will build upon what you learned before it. Think of this course like a puzzle. You are building neural pathways :)</p>

    <h2 id="1">Lesson 1</h2>
    <blockquote>
      <p>The word for <em>I</em> is <mark>a</mark> (pronounced like "ah")</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Think of just saying the english "I" but without the final "ee" sound. This word is from the Sinitic 我, which became an "ah" sound in Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese, and others.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>The word for <em>want</em> is <mark>wan</mark> (pronounced "wahn")</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>This seems strangely like the English "want", but it is actually from the Sinitic word 願 (I promise!)</p>
    <p>Now, how would you say "I want" in Manmino?</p>
    <details>
      <summary>I want.</summary>
      <p>A wan.</p>
    </details>
    <blockquote>
      <p>The word for <em>you</em> is <mark>ni</mark> (pronounced like "nee")</p>
    </blockquote>
    <details>
      <summary>You want.</summary>
      <p>Ni wan.</p>
    </details>
    <blockquote>
      <p>The word for <em>see</em> is <mark>ken</mark></p>
    </blockquote>
    <details>
      <summary>I see.</summary>
      <p>A ken.</p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>You see.</summary>
      <p>Ni ken.</p>
    </details>
    <p>To negate a verb, you place <mark>but-</mark> (pronounced like "boot") before it.</p>
    <details>
      <summary>I don't want.</summary>
      <p>A but-wan.</p>
    </details>
    <p>It's sort of like saying "I not want", isn't it?</p>
    <details>
      <summary>You don't see.</summary>
      <p>Ni but-ken.</p>
    </details>
    <blockquote>
      <p>The word for <em>that</em> is <mark>co</mark> (pronounced like "cho")</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The word order in Manmino is different from English. The verb goes last. Try to guess how you would say the following:</p>
    <details>
      <summary>I see that.</summary>
      <p>A co ken.</p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>You want that.</summary>
      <p>Ni co wan.</p>
    </details>
    <p>The negative always goes right before the verb. Can you guess how to say the following?</p>
    <details>
      <summary>I don't want that.</summary>
      <p>A co but-wan.</p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>You don't see that.</summary>
      <p>Ni co but-ken.</p>
    </details>
    <p>In this lesson, you have learned:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>a</li>
      <li>ni</li>
      <li>co</li>
      <li>wan</li>
      <li>ken</li>
      <li>but</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="2">Lesson 2</h2>
    <p>To ask a question, you simply put the question particle <mark>ka</mark> at the end of the sentence.</p>
    <details>
      <summary>Do you want that?</summary>
      <p>Ni co wan ka?</p>
    </details>
    <blockquote>
      <p>The word for <em>yes / correct</em> is <mark>bana</mark></p>
    </blockquote>
    <details>
      <summary>Yes, I want that.</summary>
      <p>Bana, a co wan.</p>
    </details>
    <p>Take your time with the following!</p>
    <details>
      <summary>You don't see that?</summary>
      <p>Ni co but-ken ka?</p>
    </details>
    <p>There are no infinitive verbs in Manmino. You just stack up the verbs one after the other.</p>
    <p>To say "I want to see", it would literally be like "[I see] <- want".</p>
    <details>
      <summary>I want to see.</summary>
      <p>A ken wan.</p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>You want to see that.</summary>
      <p>Ni co ken wan.</p>
    </details>
    <p>"[I see that] <- don't want"</p>
    <details>
      <summary>I don't want to see that.</summary>
      <p>A co ken but-wan.</p>
    </details>
    <blockquote>
      <p>The word for <em>but</em> is <mark>dan</mark> (pronounced like "dah-n")</p>
    </blockquote>
    <details>
      <summary>I see that, but I don't want to.</summary>
      <p>A co ken, dan a but-wan</p>
    </details>
    <p>In this lesson, you have learned:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>ka</li>
      <li>bana</li>
      <li>dan</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="3">Lesson 3</h2>
    <p>The past tense is expressed with the <mark>-le</mark> particle that goes after the verb</p>
    <details>
      <summary>I saw you.</summary>
      <p>A ni ken-le.</p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>You wanted that.</summary>
      <p>Ni co ken-le.</p>
    </details>
    <p>Take your time with this one!</p>
    <details>
      <summary>You wanted to see me.</summary>
      <p>Ni a ken wan-le.</p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>Did you see that?</summary>
      <p>Ni co ken-le ka?</p>
    </details>
    <blockquote>
      <p>The word for <em>no</em> is <mark>sala</mark></p>
    </blockquote>
    <details>
      <summary>No, I saw you.</summary>
      <p>Sala, a ni ken-le.</p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>I saw you, but I wanted to see that.</summary>
      <p>A ni ken-le, dan a co ken wan-le.</p>
    </details>
    <p>In this lesson, you have learned:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>sala</li>
      <li>-le</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="4">Lesson 4</h2>
    <p>You can speak in the future tense by adding the particle <mark>-kalu</mark> after the verb.</p>
    <details>
      <summary>I will see you.</summary>
      <p>A ni ken-kalu.</p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>I will see you, but I don't want to.</summary>
      <p>A ni ken-kalu, dan a but-wan.</p>
    </details>
    <p>In this lesson, you have learned:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>-kalu</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="5">Lesson 5</h2>
    <blockquote>
      <p>The word for <em>go</em> is <mark>kyo</mark></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>This word should remind you a bit of the English word "go"! It is from the Sinitic 去. Another happy accident :)</p>
    <details>
      <summary>I want to go.</summary>
      <p>A kyo wan.</p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>You went.</summary>
      <p>Ni kyo-le.</p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>I didn't go.</summary>
      <p>A but-kyo-le.</p>
    </details>
    <blockquote>
      <p>The word for <em>house/home</em> is <mark>gajek</mark></p>
    </blockquote>
    <details>
      <summary>I will see the house.</summary>
      <p>A gajek ken-kalu.</p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>Did you see the house?</summary>
      <p>Ni gajek ken-le ka?</p>
    </details>
    <blockquote>
      <p>The word for <em>to/towards</em> is <mark>-bang</mark></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>This particle comes from the Sinitic word 方 which used to be pronounced like "bang" in Middle/Old Chinese, and still is pronounced like that in Korean.</p>
    <p>In Manmino, instead of saying prepositions like "to" before the noun, we say them after the noun. So they are more like postpositions.</p>
    <details>
      <summary>to the house</summary>
      <p>gajek-bang</p>
    </details>
    <p>Think of saying "house-to" instead of "to house".</p>
    <details>
      <summary>I went to the house.</summary>
      <p>A gajek-bang kyo-le.</p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>Will you go to the house?</summary>
      <p>Ni gajek-bang kyo-kalu ka?</p>
    </details>
    <p>In this lesson, you have learned:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>kyo</li>
      <li>gajek</li>
      <li>-bang</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="6">Lesson 6</h2>
    <blockquote>
      <p>The word for <em>from</em> is <mark>-bat</mark></p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>The word for <em>school</em> is <mark>hakgyaw</mark></p>
    </blockquote>
    <details>
      <summary>from the school</summary>
      <p>hakgyaw-bat</p>
    </details>
    <p>When formulating a sentence in English, we are very accustomed to a specific order of words. But Manmino has a very different word order, as you have seen already!.</p>
    <p>Because of this, it is helpful to think of what you are trying to say before you jump right in.</p>
    <p>For example, the sentence, "I go from the house to the school". The key ideas are "I", "go", "house", "school". Now what you are left with is how to frame these ideas in the correct way. What is their relationship within the sentence?</p>
    <p>It's not just "house", but rather a movement away from the house. "gajek<b>-bat</b>".<p>
    <p>It's not just "school", but rather a movement towards the school. "hakgyaw<b>-bang</b>".<p>
    <details>
      <summary>You went from the school to the house.</summary>
      <p>Ni hakgyaw-bat gajek-bang kyo-le.</p>
    </details>
    <p>Notice how you first hear the <i>concept</i> (house, school), and then you hear the <i>relationship</i> of the concept within the sentence. Whereas in English you tend to hear the relationship of the concept first. It is just a different sort of priority, and thus it requires you to think a little differently! I believe that you will find this different way of thinking to be quite fun. I do!</p>
    <p>In this lesson, you have learned:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>hakgyaw</li>
      <li>-bat</li>
    </ul>
    
    <details>
      <summary>That is good. Now what does he want?</summary>
      <p>Co haw ya. Gim, ka hakka-(lu) wan-(ka)?</p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>He wants to drink.</summary>
      <p>Ka mwisu wan (He wants water).</p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>Can he drink?</summary>
      <p>Ka mwisu sik neng-ka? (Can he consume water?)</p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>He can drink.</summary>
      <p>Ka neng.</p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>Can you drink? Can I drink?</summary>
      <p>Ni mwisu sik neng? A mwisu sik neng?</p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>I can drink and you can drink.</summary>
      <p>A mwisu sik neng i ni mwisu sik neng.</p>
